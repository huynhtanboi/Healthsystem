The health system application is a comprehensive platform with distinct functionalities for patients, nurses, and administrators. Patients have the ability to schedule and cancel appointments, offering flexibility in managing their healthcare needs. Nurses can select and cancel their work timeslots, providing them control over their schedules. Administrators play a pivotal role, assigning nurses to timeslots and overseeing both patient and nurse information. The application also incorporates additional constraints, enhancing its relevance and applicability to real-world healthcare scenarios, ensuring a streamlined and efficient experience for all users.
